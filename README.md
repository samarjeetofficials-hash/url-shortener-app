\`\`\`

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Installation

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd url-shortener-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test Server Registration

Before using the application, you need to register with the evaluation service:

#### Registration API
\`\`\`bash
POST http://20.244.56.144/evaluation-service/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "name": "Your Name",
  "mobileNo": "1234567890",
  "githubUsername": "yourusername",
  "rollNo": "your-roll-number",
  "accessCode": "provided-access-code"
}
\`\`\`

**Response**: Returns `clientID` and `clientSecret`

#### Authentication API
\`\`\`bash
POST http://20.244.56.144/evaluation-service/auth
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "name": "Your Name",
  "rollNo": "your-roll-number",
  "accessCode": "provided-access-code",
  "clientID": "received-client-id",
  "clientSecret": "received-client-secret"
}
\`\`\`

**Response**: Returns `access_token` (automatically stored in localStorage)

### 3. Using the Application

1. **Registration & Authentication**: Complete the setup process using the evaluation service APIs
2. **Shorten URLs**: Enter long URLs with optional custom shortcodes and validity periods
3. **View Statistics**: Monitor all shortened URLs with click analytics
4. **Redirect**: Access shortened URLs at `http://localhost:3000/<shortcode>`

## üîç Key Features Explained

### URL Shortening
- Validates URL format before processing
- Generates unique 6-character shortcodes or accepts custom ones
- Configurable expiry time (1 minute to 1 week)
- Collision detection for shortcode uniqueness

### Statistics Dashboard
- Real-time analytics for all shortened URLs
- Click tracking with timestamps and user agent information
- Status indicators (Active/Expired)
- Expandable rows for detailed click information

### Logging Middleware
The application includes comprehensive logging for all major actions:

\`\`\`javascript
// Usage examples
Log("frontend", "info", "component", "URL shortened successfully");
Log("frontend", "error", "api", "Invalid URL entered by user");
Log("frontend", "warn", "component", "Shortcode collision detected");
\`\`\`

**Log Levels**: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
**Packages**: api, component, handler, etc.

### Error Handling
- Client-side validation for all inputs
- Graceful handling of expired URLs
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## üîí Security Features

- Input validation and sanitization
- Shortcode uniqueness verification
- URL format validation
- Secure token storage in localStorage

## üìä Data Storage

The application uses localStorage for client-side data persistence:
- `access_token`: Authentication token
- `shortened_urls`: Array of shortened URL objects with metadata

## üö¶ API Integration

### Logging API
\`\`\`bash
POST http://20.244.56.144/evaluation-service/logs
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "stack": "frontend",
  "level": "info",
  "package": "component",
  "message": "User action description",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
\`\`\`

## üß™ Testing

The application includes comprehensive error handling and validation:
- URL format validation
- Shortcode uniqueness checking
- Expiry time validation
- Authentication state management

## üìù Development Notes

- All major user actions are logged using the middleware
- Material UI components ensure consistent design
- Responsive layout works on desktop and mobile
- Client-side routing handles all navigation
- localStorage provides session persistence
